Description
-----------

This is a learning project developed as part of The Odin Project (www.theodinproject.com). The goal of this project is to use JavaScript to program a four-function calculator. The calculator can be used by clicking the buttons to input numbers or operations, or to get the result of an expression. All operations are performed immediately as they are entered.

The clear button can be used to reset the input or clear any errors (such as a division by zero).

Keyboard input is also supported - numbers and operators can be typed simply except for negation. To get the result, use the Enter/Return key. To clear the calculator, use the Backspace, Delete, or C key. To negate the current value, type an underscore ('_', which is typically shift and the '-' key).
